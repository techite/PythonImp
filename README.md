# PythonImp
Collection of interesting python scripts designed to automate certain tasks. 
<BR/> <b>Module 1: Search Engine (search.py)</b>
<BR/> This module helps you in executing search queries on multiple search engines with a single input and saves your time from entering the query on different search engines individually. 
<BR/> <b>Module 2: Auto Load URLs (autoload.py)</b>
<BR/> This module helps you in loading several URLs into multiple browsers at the same time. Imagine a situation where you have to browse 30 websites one by one every other day. Everytime going to the bookmarks and opening URL is actually boring. With this module, all you need to do is: enter all such URLs in a.txt and run this module.
